Run program:
cd to the file's directory
python CIS563-HW2.py (or python3 CIS563-HW2.py)
(I use python3 to do this problem)

There are some packages we need to install:
open cmd
pip install nltk (or pip3 install nltk)
pip install re (or pip3 install re)
pip install sklearn (or pip3 install sklearn)

If the file can not be opened, then you can check whether the file you use is the same as the file name I use. (In line 15 and in line 44)
I do not include food.txt in the zip file, you can download that txt from the website
And the file of food.txt should be coded as UTF-8 (in windows system, food.txt can be saved as UTF-8)
